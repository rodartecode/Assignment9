For this assignment, implement a C++ program to track patients entering and leaving a hospital emergency 
room.  Patients coming into the emergency room are assigned a priority by the triage team and then wait 
in the waiting room for a healthcare provider.  When a healthcare provider becomes available, the patient 
with the highest priority is called and removed from the waiting room.  


A heap is a good choice to implement a priority queue, which is what we need for this problem.  Implement 
a class for an array-based heap using the algorithms discussed in class and in your textbook.
